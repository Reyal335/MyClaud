# MyClaud design reference

These files are static mockups. Open any `.html` file in a browser to see it.
They show the intended look and layout, not working code. Build the real
components in React and match these visually.

## Screens

| File | Screen |
| --- | --- |
| `1-inbox.html` | Inbox: nav, conversation list, selected conversation preview |
| `2-conversation.html` | Conversation: history, tool cards, mascot with RPG dialogue box, input |
| `3-agent-manager.html` | Agent list (project / global) and the edit form with 16x16 icon upload |
| `4-mascot-manager.html` | Mascot gallery and the upload dialog with one loop per state |
| `5-popup-notifications.html` | The three popup variants: finished, needs approval, error |
| `6-mascot-states.html` | The five mascot states |
| `mascot.png` | Default mascot image used in the mockups |

## Colors

| Token | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bg | `#0B132B` | App background, input backgrounds |
| panel | `#1C2541` | Panels, cards, sidebar |
| line | `#3A506B` | Default borders, user message bubble |
| accent | `#5BC0BE` | Active nav, primary buttons, agent names |
| text | `#F2F4F8` | Main text, emphasis borders |
| muted | `#A9B6C6` | Secondary text, "done" status |
| running | `#6FCF7F` | Running status |
| waiting | `#F2B84B` | Waiting for approval |
| error | `#F0706A` | Error status and validation errors |
| shadow | `#000000` | Hard drop shadows |

`#3A506B` is too dark for text on the navy backgrounds. Use it for borders only.

## Type

- Headings, labels, buttons, tags: `'Press Start 2P'`, 8 to 14px.
- Chat text, descriptions, code, inputs: `'IBM Plex Mono'`, 12 to 15px, line height 1.5.
- Never set paragraphs in the pixel font.

## Shape rules

- No rounded corners, no gradients, no blurred shadows.
- Borders are 4px solid (2px on small tags and tool cards).
- Shadows are hard offsets: `4px 4px 0 #000` on buttons, `6px 6px 0 #000` on dialogue boxes and dialogs.
- Selected or unread items: `#F2F4F8` border with a `4px 4px 0 #5BC0BE` shadow.
- Buttons and inputs are at least 44px tall.
- Pixel art scales by whole numbers only, with `image-rendering: pixelated`.

## Status

Every status shows a colored square and a text label, never color alone.

| Status | Color | Label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Running | running | RUNNING |
| Waiting for approval | waiting | WAITING |
| Done | muted | DONE |
| Error | error | ERROR |

Conversations waiting for approval count as unread in the inbox.

## Mascots

- A mascot has five states: idle, thinking, talking, working, asking.
- Each state has its own spritesheet and its own FPS.
- Spritesheet format: PNG, horizontal strip of 64x64 frames. Height exactly
  64px, width a multiple of 64, at most 16 frames. Reject anything else with
  a specific message, for example "Height must be 64px. Yours is 128px."
- Idle is required. A state with no sheet plays the idle loop.
- Display at 1x, 2x, or 3x only.

## Agent icons

- PNG, exactly 16x16. Reject anything else: "Icon must be exactly 16x16."
  Do not auto-resize.
- Displayed at 2x (inbox rows), 3x (cards, headers), 4x (edit form preview).
- Agents without an icon get the default question-mark icon.
- The icons in the mockups are placeholders drawn as inline SVG.

## Popup notification

- Small frameless, always-on-top window in the bottom-right screen corner.
- About 340px wide, 140px tall. The approval variant is taller to fit its buttons.
- Layout: mascot on the left, speech bubble on the right with the agent's
  16x16 icon and name in the bubble header.
- Border color follows the variant: text color for finished, waiting color
  for approval, error color for error.
- Approval variant has Approve, Deny, and Open buttons.
